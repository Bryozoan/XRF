# XRF_Code
 Code for analysing XRF data initally

This code is being developed to be used with the x-Ray florecence (XRF) intrument in the Department of Geological Sciences at Brigham Young University (BYU). This code is being developed voluntarily, with no official purpose, or direction. It is hoped to eventually helpful to those running the XRF lab, and those who have datasets from, or similar to that produced by the XRF.
